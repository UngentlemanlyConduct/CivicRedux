THE CIVIC REDUX REPOSITORY

This is the official Civic Redux GitHub Repository. I made this as a place to put the source code of the mod and make it available for people to create ComPatches, Collab Mods or general updates.

ABOUT CIVIC REDUX
Civic Redux is a mod for the Paradox game Stellaris that increases the amount of available Civics dramatically, and was designed to help with immersion, storytelling and gameplay. Some of these Civics cause widespread changes to your empire at the start of the game, or for a time after.
This uses the Stellaris in-game syntax for game files and YAML (Ain't Markup Language) for localisation.

RULES
While the source files are freely available to use, there are some caveats that I'd like you to be aware of if you're going to use this:

1. Do not use any of the content in your own mod, then pass it off as all your own work. If you want to use it to create a mod, please contact me first on Steam (Ungentlemanly Conduct) - I don't bite.
    Generally, if you ask me it'll be alright. If you don't, and I find it about, I will try and contact you about it, and get (belated) permission if it's fair use. If it's a blatant copy, I'll flag it.
2. Do not monetise any of the content in this mod, either from a directly charging site or from a donation site like Patreon.
    First, it's cheap. Second, this is freely available content, people generally dislike paid mods, and I won't EVER ask for money or donations through Patreon or anything like that. Third, making money off someone else's free content, no matter how, is essentially stealing someone's hard work and profiting off it.

GUIDELINES
These aren't official Rules, and while I'd like you to follow them, I won't stop you from doing it as long as it doesn't break the rules:

1. You are free to use the mods' contents as a learning tool, but don't just copypaste it and replace the words. Some of the things in this mod were pretty tough to pull off (hello Starborn Swarm), so if it helps you make your stuff, that's fine. However, if you are learning to mod, copypasting is generally a bad idea unless you know what you're doing.
2. If you do end up creating a mod with inspiration from this, please leave a mention about it. It means a lot.
3. If what you're making is a straight-up improvement to the mod (especially the art. I suck at art) I may ask you to upload it straight to the repository. If this happens, you'll get listed as a contributor on the mod. I can't offer any other sort of reward unfortunately.
4. If you're making a compatch (to make two mods work together) or a collab mod (a bunch of mods stuck together) please get permission from the other developers.

I can't think of anything else to add at this moment, SOOOOOOOOO I'm gonna leave it here.
