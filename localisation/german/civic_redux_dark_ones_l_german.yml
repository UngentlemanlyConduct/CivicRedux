 credux_dark_ones.01.desc:0 "§RThey worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway.§! §T- H.P. Lovecraft; The Call of Cthulu (1926)§!\n\nThe Dark Influence Civic makes some significant changes that you should be aware of before you being playing.\nEach planet that you capture or colonise will be marked by Dark Ones, whose mood -unique for each planet - shifts over time between Pleased, Content and Hungry. While the Dark Ones are pleased, they will provide bonuses to the planet. Contention and Hunger do not provide bonuses, but the must be kept above Hunger, lest you invoke their wrath.\nYou may sacrifice Pops to the Dark Ones to appease them through the use of the Planet Edict Dark Tribute. This will set their mood to Pleased."

With our data on the colony having never shown any similar events, scientists are baffled as to the cause - some have suggested outside influences at work.\n\n[Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Root.Owner.GetRulerName] has immediately ordered a relief effort on the planet, and aid generously provided by citizens across the empire has repaired the worst of the damage.\n\nWe are continuing to investigate the cause of these geological occurances."

 credux_dark_ones.7.desc:0 "Disturbing reports are coming in from [Root.GetName]. Apparantly, there was a chaotic storm engulfing the planet through the night. No damage to infastructure was reported. However, the citizens seem to have... vanished.\nFor want of a better word.\n\nAs if in a single blow, populous cities and thriving townships were suddenly stolen of its myriad citizens. Survivors told authorities that friends, neighbours, even family... they were taken. Vanished, like the dying breath of a terrible storm.\n\nWe have sent relief supplies and administrative support to the planet, but it will be years - if ever - before [Root.GetName] recovers from this dark chapter."
