 pc_barren_unstable:0 "Forsaken World"
 pc_barren_unstable_desc:0 "Barren and rocky world with a thin atmosphere, covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The foundations of an atmosphere and some frozen water is present - but in its current state is unsuitable for sustaining life."
 pc_barren_stable:0 "Dead World"
 pc_barren_stable_desc:0 "Barren and rocky world with a thin atmosphere, covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. While there is a notable atmosphere and even some liquid water, it remains an unsuitable candidate for colonisation."

 pc_toxic_detox1:0 "Corrupted World"
 pc_toxic_detox2_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. While far from being able to reasonably sustain life, the highly acidic and alkaline nature of the atmosphere has been toned down."
 pc_toxic_detox2:0 "Poisoned World"
 pc_toxic_detox2_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that, save for some ammonia-based lifeforms, is lethal to all known higher forms of life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The most toxic elements of the planet's atmosphere have been purified, and simple microbial life, lethal to all other life on contact, has started to develop."
 pc_toxic_detox3:0 "Fallen World"
 pc_toxic_detox3_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a semi-thick atmosphere. Persistent acid rainstorms and highly alkaline soil make this world lethal to all known higher forms of life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The atmosphere has been reduced and cleansed of almost all pollutants. The soil and water on the planet are still in too extreme a condition to consider colonisation."
 pc_toxic_detox4:0 "Scarred World"
 pc_toxic_detox4_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a semi-thick atmosphere. Persistent acid rainstorms and highly alkaline soil make this world suitable only for ammonia-based lifeforms.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The soil has been moderately acidified and water conditions are slowly returning to a pH-neutral level. The microbial organisms remains hostile to life." 
 pc_toxic_detox5:0 "Wounded World"
 pc_toxic_detox5_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a nitrogen-rich atmosphere. Ammonia-based lifeforms and acid rainstorms ravage the planet, making this world suitable only for ammonia-based lifeforms.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The pH level of the soil is almost perfectly suited to normal conditions, and the microbial life is much less hostile to life than before." 
 
 pc_molten_cold1:0 "Infernal World"
 pc_molten_cold1_desc:0 "Rocky world that is scorching hot. The atmosphere is non-existent, and lava from the interior flows freely due to constant volcanic eruptions. This type of planet cannot sustain organic life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The planet's atmosphere has been almost completely destroyed - presumably to let in cold air from space. It remains unsuitable for life."
 pc_molten_cold2:0 "Burning World"
 pc_molten_cold2_desc:0 "Rocky world that is extremely hot. The atmosphere is non-existent, and lava from the interior flows freely due to constant volcanic eruptions. This type of planet cannot sustain organic life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Surface temperatures are lower than normally expected for this type of world. The volcanic eruptions are less frequent, but the sheer heat and lack of atmosphere means the planet cannot sustain life."
 pc_molten_cold3:0 "Scorching World"
 pc_molten_cold3_desc:0 "Rocky world that is extremely hot. The atmosphere is very thin, and the frequent volcanic eruptions spew out immense amounts of lava. Microbial life survives here, but is far too extreme for more complex forms to develop.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Many of the volcanic eruptions have been halted, and an atmosphere has been reintroduced to retain some of the colder conditions."
 pc_molten_cold4:0 "Chaotic World"
 pc_molten_cold4_desc:0 "Rocky world that is very hot. The atmosphere is thin, and persistent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions spew out large amounts of lava. Microbial life survives here, but is far too extreme for more complex forms to develop.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Surface tempreatures have reached an almost-suitable level for life, but multiple earthquakes and volcanic eruptions means complex life cannot survive."
 pc_molten_cold5:0 "Unstable World"
 pc_molten_cold5_desc:0 "Rocky world that is very hot. Frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruption spew out large amounts of lava. Microbial life survives here, but is far too extreme for more complex forms to develop.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The planet's crust has been stabilised to the point where volcanic eruptions and gas geysers have become an infrequent occurence. Much work reamins to be done, though, for this world to become habitable for life."
 
 pc_frozen_heat1:0 "Cryo World"
 pc_frozen_heat1_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The atmospheric and surface temperature of the world are higher than expected of similar planets, but fails to permeate the thick ice on the surface. No surface life can survive."
 pc_frozen_heat2:0 "Frigid World"
 pc_frozen_heat2_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a semi thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Some of the permafrost has begun to lift, and there are now distinct weak points within the ice. An atmosphere has formed to contain some of the heat inducted onto the world."
 pc_frozen_heat3:0 "Icestorm World"
 pc_frozen_heat3_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of frozen ice. Somewhat low temperatures and a semi thin atmosphere, coupled with powerful blizzards, precludes the existence of life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Localised pollution has increased the temperature of several regions dramatically. However, a side effect of the forming atmosphere has revealed itself - huge gale-force winds packing bitterly cold winds and ice shards broken from the melted regions. It remains impossible for surface life to survive."
 pc_frozen_heat4:0 "Blizzard World"
 pc_frozen_heat4_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a layer of frozen ice. Low temperatures and a semi thin atmosphere, coupled with powerful blizzards, precludes the existence of complex life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The ice has begun to melt in several regions, creating slushy rivers and lakes on the surface. Meanwhile, the planet's core has heated up in response to our atmospheric efforts, further pushing the thaw and the temperature. The windstorms remain a serious threat to existence on the surface."
 pc_frozen_heat5:0 "Glacial World"
 pc_frozen_heat5_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a layer of frozen ice, with some glaciers dotted in the oceans. A somewhat stable atmosphere, coupled with powerful blizzards, precludes the existence of complex life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Large glaciers have broken off the main landscape of the planets and drift across the ocean. The severity of the blizzards has also calmed, and efforts can now be directed to stabilising both the atmosphere and the planet's new temperature."
